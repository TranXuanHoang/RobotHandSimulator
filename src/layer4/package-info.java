/**
 * Layer 4 – Distributed Control Layer: provides distributed control
 * for distributed software system. When the factory robots need a
 * complex and distributed software system, this layer will provide a
 * consistent way for managing all the logical control businesses between
 * the robots so that these robots will smoothly co-operate together.
 * 
 * NOTE: In this project we demonstrate only one robot working to sort
 *    objects in a specified order. It is however required that a number
 *    of robots may cooperate in order to finish the task quicker,
 *    especially in the real-world robot industry. For now, we
 *    temporarily leave this package without any classes. But we
 *    do create this package to full-fill our feasible design that
 *    can be applicable to solve more complicated problems
 *    (e.g. real-world robots cooperating in a group)

/**
 * Layer 3 – Production Management Server: plays the role of holding
 * information about products that the factory robots will produce.
 * 
 *  NOTE: Since this project is a simulation of a real-world robot,
 *     both the products and robot are simulated as graphical user
 *     interface (GUI) and we do not pay attention to the products
 *     information. This layer, therefore, does not contain any classes.
 *     However, in the real-level problem in which a software is designed
 *     to embedded inside and control a real robot, we may need to add
 *     further class to save information about the products that the
 *     robot interact with or produces out.
